My collection of css snippets for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

### Drop caps


This snippet implements [drop caps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial) in Obsidian.

The letter to alter is sourrounded by the following tags:

```html
<span style="dcaps">I</span>
```

### Embeddable quotes

The style of the H6 header is similar to that of the quote block. In this way multiple quotes contained in multiple files can be easily embedded indivually.

```markdown
![[quotes#Power is not a means, it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power.]]
```

### Images

Images have rounded corners, nice hover effect, drop shadow and they can be aligned.

```markdown
![[image.png|center|500]]
```
