`Appearance.css` contains adjustments to make Obsidian blend in Gnome.

`Article.css` and `Drop caps.css` add `cssclass`es for optional styles. They are obtained by adding `cssclass: article, dcaps` to the note properties (both shown in the picture).

The rest of the CSS improves consistency with the default theme and removes clutter.
